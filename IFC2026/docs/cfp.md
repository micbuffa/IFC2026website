This track aims at welcoming contributions from solo developers, designers, artists, hackers, industry professionals, or broadly speaking practitioners, who wish to share knowledge about FAUST related topics, but are not used to the standards of academic writing. The proposal must include a title, a brief related work, a description of the work or topic to be presented and a short biography of the author(s). Please contact the session chairs if you have questions and / or need some support.

Performance submissions consist of a 1-2 page extended abstract (PDF or MarkDown or LaTex, that will not be integrated to the proceedings) that must include a title, a description of the performance, links to audio / video documentation of the work, biographies of all performers and a complete list of technical requirements. If your proposal requires unusual equipment to be provided by conference organizers, please contact the session chairs to ensure the feasibility of the proposal.

Artwork and demo submissions consist of a 1-2 page extended abstract (PDF or MarkDown or LatTeX, that will not be integrated to the proceedings) including a title, a description of the project, diagrams, images or links to online resources. Works must be suitable for presentation on a computer kiosk with headphones.
